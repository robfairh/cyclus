.. current developments

v1.5.4
====================

**Added:**

* Python bindings to the ``Position`` class.
* Input validation for Latitude and Longitude
* New `Mocksim::DummyProto` where capacity and commodity of the prototype can be defined.
* The Python typesystem generator has been extended to include
  types that should be passed by their C++ shared pointers, such
  as resources. ``Materials`` and ``Products`` have thus been added as
  fully valid types on their own in the typesystem.  Note that since
  resources already have classes of their own in the typesystem, state
  variables for these classes are ``MaterialStateVar`` and ``ProductStateVar``.
* Added the Decision Phase. This phase occurs after the tock phase and allows
  cyclus agents to make decisions based on what has occured during the
  tick and tock phase of the current timestep. 


**Changed:**

* `cycpp.py` now takes advantage of the `$CPP` environment variable if defined,
  falls back on `cpp` if not defined
* `cyclus_deps` docker container built now on debian9, removed gcc from apt-get
  package, build the full list of conda package (don't rely on cyclus-deps conda
  package as it is temporary broken), define CXX CC and CPP environment variable
* `cython` compatibility limited to >=0.25 and <0.27
* ``dbtypes_gen.py`` will now throw approriate errors for incorrect
  JSON in ``queryable_backend.h``.
* Python interface will now raise exceptions when it encounters an error in C++ or
  Cython.
* Updated cycstub readme to reflect changes
* Updated the record time series function to also include the name of the field being
  recorded. 



**Deprecated:**


**Fixed:**

* `boost/uuid/sha1.hpp` include now varies according to the Boost version
  installed due to its deprecation in boost > 1.67
* Python inventories required a value for ``capacity`` even though it was optional. This
  change also enables ``None`` valued capacities, which are treated as infinite.
* Fixed issue where resource buffer Python bidnings would attempt to append to
  the resources themselves when popping resources out of the buffers.
* Fixed issue when pushing many resources to a resource buffer would attempt to
  append the entire buffer
* Error in generation of ``dbtypes.json`` file led to incorrect
  enumeration of of some database types. This in turn led to segfaults
  when using these types in the Python typesystem. It also made the HDF5
  backend generator skip some types.
* Invalid JSON in ``queryable_backend.h`` has been fixed.
* Fixed cycstub build issue which failed to find Cyclus shared libraries
* Fixed cycstub unit test issue that failed to locate stub library shared object




v1.5.3
====================

**Added:**

* New ``CYCLUS_PLATFORM`` string for uniquely identifying the
  platform.  This is initialized with the ``cyclus_platform()``
  macro.
* New ``download_platform()`` macro for downloading a tar.gz
  file and its platform-specific equivalent.


**Changed:**

None

* Cyclus agent libraries will now have the the install directroy and
  rpath correctly set to when using the ``install_agent_lib()`` in CMake.
* Updated how fast compiling downloads and searches for files so that
  only platform-specific files are grabbed.


**Deprecated:**

* CMake policies CMP0040 and CMP0042 supressed.


**Fixed:**

* Fixed issue with ``cyclus_unit_tests`` not being able to find
  the agents library in linking on macOS.
* Fixed SQLite backend bug with Boost v1.66.
* CMake RPATH now correctly uses semicolon delimiters, rather
  than colons.
* ``DynamicLoadingTests`` now properly start/stop Python.




v1.5.2
====================

**Changed:**

* Unit tests now link to libcyclus and agents, rather than recompiling all the sources
  into the test executable.


**Fixed:**

* Fixed issue with Python agent state vars that were set in the input file
  instead using the default value set on the archetype for optional state vars.
* Fixed issue with Python agent prototypes not being registered correctly when created.
  This caused segfaults due the the agents being deallocated too soon.
* Fixed many issues with institution kinds checking "Institution", rather than "Inst".
